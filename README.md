# Film Gender Classification

This project explores gender balance in Hollywood movies by using machine learning to predict whether the lead actor in a film is male or female. The goal is to learn from film metadata — like dialogue distribution, number of male/female characters, and release year — and build a model that can classify the gender of the lead role.

It’s inspired by research on gender bias in film dialogue and uses a dataset of over 1,000 movies to explore patterns, trends, and predictive signals.
